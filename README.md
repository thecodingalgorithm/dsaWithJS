## Hi, and welcome.

I am Ibrahim Taofeek, it's nice having you here.

I learnt data structures and algorithm whilst I was student at this [federal univeristy](https://ecampus.fuoye.edu.ng/) in nigeria. It was interesting, challenging and engaging.

Permit me to introduce to you, my brilliant lecturer, [Joshua Bature Hassan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-bature-hassan-33b94977/). He tried with his explanations.


However, I still see the need to learn more about data structure and algorithms, which is why I started taking this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP) by [Code Volution](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution).


I will be using this repo to document my studies.


The tutorial was taken with Javascript, so I planned to write with typescript and possibly add some unit testing to it.

If you think this is interesting, kindly star the repo
